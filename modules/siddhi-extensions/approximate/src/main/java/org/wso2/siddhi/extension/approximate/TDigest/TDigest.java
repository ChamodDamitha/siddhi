/**
 * Adaptive histogram based on something like streaming k-means crossed with Q-digest.
 * <p/>
 * The special characteristics of this algorithm are:
 * <p/>
 * a) smaller summaries than Q-digest
 * <p/>
 * b) works on doubles as well as integers.
 * <p/>
 * c) provides part per million accuracy for extreme quantiles and typically <1000 ppm accuracy for middle quantiles
 * <p/>
 * d) fast
 * <p/>
 * e) simple
 * <p/>
 * f) test coverage > 90%
 * <p/>
 * g) easy to adapt for use with map-reduce
